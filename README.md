For use, you need to copy sheet.html into the HTML box and style.css into the style box when picking 'custom sheet' on the Roll20 settings. Then save your settings and you're good to go!

# Roll info:
Success count is how many dice you held+1 default.
When holding, if you plan to spend mood markers and hold, always include total holds! (They will be added to your success count)
For mood, you can spend the markers as dice by writing in xd6, or xd6+y if you aren't spending all of them, it'll roll properly.

# Please let us know how it goes, and if you have any comments/suggestions for functionalities.

# Next addons:
 - Initiative Button
 - EXP and other character info basics at the top.
